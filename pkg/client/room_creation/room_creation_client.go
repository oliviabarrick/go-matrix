/*
CreateRoom creates a new room

Create a new room with various configuration options.

The server MUST apply the normal state resolution rules when creating
the new room, including checking power levels for each event. It MUST
apply the events implied by the request in the following order:

0. A default ``m.room.power_levels`` event, giving the room creator
   (and not other members) permission to send state events. Overridden
   by the ``power_level_content_override`` parameter.

1. Events set by the ``preset``. Currently these are the ``m.room.join_rules``,
   ``m.room.history_visibility``, and ``m.room.guest_access`` state events.

2. Events listed in ``initial_state``, in the order that they are
   listed.

3. Events implied by ``name`` and ``topic`` (``m.room.name`` and ``m.room.topic``
   state events).

4. Invite events implied by ``invite`` and ``invite_3pid`` (``m.room.member`` with
   ``membership: invite`` and ``m.room.third_party_invite``).

The available presets do the following with respect to room state:

========================  ==============  ======================  ================  =========
         Preset           ``join_rules``  ``history_visibility``  ``guest_access``  Other
========================  ==============  ======================  ================  =========
``private_chat``          ``invite``      ``shared``              ``can_join``
``trusted_private_chat``  ``invite``      ``shared``              ``can_join``      All invitees are given the same power level as the room creator.
``public_chat``           ``public``      ``shared``              ``forbidden``
========================  ==============  ======================  ================  =========

The server will create a ``m.room.create`` event in the room with the
requesting user as the creator, alongside other keys provided in the
``creation_content``.
